# DJ's Wordle

## Description

Wordle is a classic word puzzle game where players try to guess a secret word within a limited number of attempts. In each guess, players are provided with feedback indicating if the letters guessed are correct and if they are in the right position. Using deduction and logic, players aim to guess the word correctly within the given constraints.

## Features

- Responsive Design: The application is designed to be responsive and accessible across various devices and screen sizes.
- Interactive Feedback: Enjoy interactive feedback as you make guesses, with visual cues to assist in the guessing process.
- Confetti Celebration: Celebrate your victories with an animated confetti effect upon successfully guessing the word.

## Multiple Game Modes

- Classic Wordle: Each day, players can attempt to guess the 'official' word of the day, which is the same for all players playing.
- Endless Wordle: Players start by guessing a 3-letter word, and with each correct guess, they are given a word with one more letter than the last.
- Custom Wordle: Players can create their own Wordle challenges by inputting a custom word and the number of guesses they'd like their challenger to have. They can either play their custom Wordle right away, or send the generated URL to their challenger.
